> Relief drawn by density, never by shadow.

Hachure is Case 05 in the design-system library: a cartographic interface system for terrain, weather and field data, built from the supplied \`RidgelineDitherFooter\` component. The component is a tone engine — ridged fractal noise, an 8×8 Bayer matrix, a seven-step palette whose first step is the paper, a drifting mist field and a back-to-front reveal. The system is the decision about what that engine is for.

## The rule

Depth is density, not shadow. Every tonal step is a palette index chosen per cell by a Bayer threshold. There are no gradients, no \`box-shadow\` and no opacity tints: a cell is ink or it is paper. Tone 1 is the paper colour, which is why the top of the range can dissolve into the page rather than fade out of it.

## The fusion

Six directions were considered for the component's interface. Two were borrowed and two refused:

1. Terrain console — refused: night radar is a cliché with worse contrast.
2. Editorial riso zine — refused: that is Case 04 and it earned it.
3. Data-relief dashboard — borrowed: the chart has to be honest, so contrast is measured in the build.
4. Cartographic survey sheet — kept: hachure, margins, benchmark numerals, one loud field.
5. Mist-lens explorer — borrowed: the pointer parts the mist and reads a crest height.
6. Bento relief cards — refused: dither as garnish in a rounded box.

Category defaults rejected: the soft card shadow, the gradient sky, and the isosceles-triangle peak logo.

## Elevation

There are three bands because an interface has three levels of meaning.

| Band | Altitude | What lives there |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Range | 400–3,000 m | The site footer, and only the footer — the one loud field |
| Bench | 40 m | Panels, inputs, table headers: one hairline and one tone |
| Ground | 0 m | The page, survey stock, reading type. Nothing sits below it |

Using the dither plate anywhere but the footer spends the system's one loud field on the first screen, so it is not allowed.

## Mark

A drawn asymmetric ridge on a 64 grid: apex (26, 13), knee (38, 34), feet (10, 50) and (54, 50). Solid above row 42; rows 42 and 46 break into 4-unit cells at 82% and 44% coverage, thresholded by the same Bayer matrix the footer samples. One path, no mask, no second colour, 14 foot cells. The compact variant redraws the base on a 2-unit grid for 16px. Six marks were drawn and five were rejected in \`design/brand/hachure/explorations/directions.md\`.

## Wordmark

"hachure" outlined from Geist Mono 700 into a single path. Never live text, never a webfont dependency. The lockup places the mark and wordmark 16 units apart.

## Palette

| Primitive | Value | Role |
| --- | --- | --- |
${rows(tokens.primitives)}

## Tone ramp — light

| Step | Value |
| --- | --- |
${tokens.tones.light.map((tone, index) => `| ${index + 1} | ${tone} |`).join('\n')}

## Tone ramp — night

| Step | Value |
| --- | --- |
${tokens.tones.dark.map((tone, index) => `| ${index + 1} | ${tone} |`).join('\n')}

Night is not the light ramp inverted: the near ridges get lighter, the way a moonlit face catches light.

## Semantic tokens — light

| Token | Value | Role |
| --- | --- | --- |
${rows(tokens.semantic.light)}

## Semantic tokens — night

| Token | Value | Role |
| --- | --- | --- |
${rows(tokens.semantic.dark)}

## Colour rules

- Lichen \`#C9D94E\` is a fill, never a letter: ${failing[0]?.ratio.toFixed(2) ?? '1.40'}:1 on stock.
- Moss \`#4A6B33\` is the type-safe green, and tone 5 follows it so the footer and page agree.
- Survey red \`#A82A1C\` is functional only: errors, never identity.
- Night paper is \`#0A110D\` — a green-black, not \`#000\`.

## Type

| Role | Face | Weight | Size | Leading | Tracking |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
${tokens.type.map((row) => `| ${row.role} | ${row.face === 'mono' ? 'Geist Mono' : 'Geist'} | ${row.weight} | ${row.size} | ${row.leading} | ${row.tracking} |`).join('\n')}

Mono carries the display, labels, coordinates, altitudes and the wordmark; Geist reads. Two families, both already loaded by the host.

## Space and motion

${tokens.space.map((row) => `- \`--hx-space-${row.name}\`: ${row.value} — ${row.use}`).join('\n')}

${tokens.motion.map((row) => `- \`--hx-dur-${row.name}\`: ${row.value} — ${row.use}`).join('\n')}

The footer's reveal runs once, in this order: frame guides (1.4s), brand (140ms), ridges back to front (380ms, 170ms apart), copyright (1250ms), altimeter armed (1600ms). Reduced motion resolves to the finished plate, the mist holds still and the pointer clearing is off; the altimeter still reads.

## Contrast, measured in the build

Ratios are computed from the semantic layer by \`scripts/build-hachure-brand.mjs\`; none are typed beside the colour.

| Pair | Theme | Colours | Ratio | Level |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
${pairs}

${failing.length ? `The failing pair is kept visible as a rule rather than fixed by drifting the colour: ${failing.map((pair) => `${pair.label} at ${pair.ratio.toFixed(2)}:1`).join(', ')}.` : 'No pair fails.'}

## Components

- \`features/hachure/components/brand.tsx\`: \`HachureMark\`, \`HachureWordmark\`, \`HachureLockup\`, \`Benchmark\`.
- \`features/hachure/components/controls.tsx\`: ground/night switch; the page root carries \`data-theme\` so the token layer decides what each role resolves to.
- \`features/hachure/components/hero-plate.tsx\`: the hero plate, revealed once by the same engine as the footer.
- \`features/hachure/components/dither-study.tsx\`: tones, ridges, cell size, mist and a \`develop\` scrub, plus the Bayer matrix.
- \`features/hachure/components/elevation-study.tsx\`: the three bands, with what lives on each.
- \`features/hachure/components/form-demo.tsx\`: "File a site report" — station, correction address, datum, spot height, report kind, note, quote consent. Errors are summarised with anchor links and focus moves to the first problem.
- \`features/hachure/components/footer-demo.tsx\`: the \`RidgelineDitherFooter\` specimen with seed, ridge count, mist and altimeter controls; it follows the page theme through a MutationObserver.
- \`components/ui/ridgeline-dither-footer.tsx\`: the supplied component, unmodified in behaviour.

## Not verified

Print output. The palette is a screen approximation of a two-ink survey sheet; halftone at 2px, paper absorption and the real lichen ink have not been proofed. The altimeter reads a generated elevation, not a surveyed one. The component's \`backdrop-filter\` altimeter badge has not been checked in Safari. The Playwright e2e suite was skipped for this case.
