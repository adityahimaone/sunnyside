 * The live dashboard, in the shape the system ships it: a scoped `[data-ledger]`
 * subtree so the portfolio's own tokens never leak in, and the site chrome
 * retired while the rail is on screen.
 *
 * The field paints at z-0 and the shell sits at z-10. `-z-10` cannot be used
 * here: the scoped wrapper carries the opaque canvas colour, and a negative
 * child would paint underneath it.
